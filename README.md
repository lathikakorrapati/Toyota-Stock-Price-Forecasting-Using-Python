🚗 Toyota Stock Price Forecasting using Time-Series Models
This project focuses on analysing and forecasting the historical stock prices of Toyota Motor Corporation 📊 using advanced time-series methods. The dataset includes daily stock information from 1980 to 2025. The aim is to understand long-term price behaviour, identify patterns, and develop predictive models capable of estimating future closing prices 📈.

The workflow begins with data preparation including date conversion, indexing, handling of time-based features and exploratory visual inspection of the long historical trend as well as recent movements. Several engineered features such as lag variables and moving averages were used to enrich the dataset and provide additional temporal context for the forecasting models 🧠.

The study evaluates multiple forecasting approaches. Baseline methods such as a one-day lag forecast and a seven-day moving average create initial benchmarks. Traditional statistical modelling is carried out using ARIMA, while a more seasonality-aware approach is implemented using the Prophet forecasting model 🔮. Each model generates predictions for the test period and is evaluated using standard error metrics such as MAE and RMSE.

Visualisations play an essential role in the interpretation of the results. The project includes charts for historical price movement, train-test segmentation, model forecasts versus actual values, residual behaviour and seasonal components produced by Prophet 📎📉. These visual elements offer an intuitive understanding of model performance and market dynamics.

The project demonstrates practical knowledge of time-series forecasting, including feature engineering, statistical testing, model fitting, error evaluation and interpretation of results 🧩. It also highlights important financial insights that can support future predictive research, business forecasting or integration with dashboard tools such as Power BI or web-based analytics 🌐.
